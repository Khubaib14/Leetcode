Approach 1 (Trivial): Square and then sort
Approach 2: (Personal): Insert and delete elements to create an array sorted on basis of absolute values and then square.
Approach 3: (Personal with hint): Have 2 pointers at both ends. Square elements from the ends, see which is greater, insert at fron of another list. Whichever side's square is chosen, that pointer moves towards the center.
